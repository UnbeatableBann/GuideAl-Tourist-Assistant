# **GuideAI: AI-Powered Tourist Guide**  

## **Overview**  
**GuideAI** is an AI-based travel assistant that helps users find locations, plan trips, get real-time navigation, and explore activities. It leverages AI for enhanced recommendations and smooth travel experiences.  

This project was developed in collaboration with my friend during the **IBM State-Level Hackathon**, where we built an AI-powered travel guide to assist tourists with seamless navigation, trip planning, and real-time updates. 🚀  

## **Features**  
- ✅ **Live Location Tracking** – Get real-time location updates.  
- ✅ **Trip Planning** – AI-powered itinerary suggestions.  
- ✅ **Navigation Assistance** – Find the best routes and directions.  
- ✅ **Activity Recommendations** – Discover places to visit and things to do.  
- ✅ **Multilingual Support** – Interact in multiple languages for a better user experience.  
- ✅ **AI-Powered Image Recognition** – Upload an image to get relevant location details.  
- ✅ **IBM Watson Integration** – Uses AI-powered services for natural language understanding.

## **Security Considerations**  
🔴 **Important:** To protect sensitive data, ensure the following files are **not shared publicly**:  
- `.env` (Contains API keys and secret credentials)  
- Any files containing **private API keys** or **database credentials**  

Ensure that `.gitignore` includes:  
```
.env
__pycache__/
.flask_session/
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```

## **Hackathon Experience 🎯**  
GuideAI was developed as part of the **IBM State-Level Hackathon**, where my friend and I collaborated to create an AI-driven travel assistant. Our goal was to enhance tourism experiences using AI and real-time data, providing travelers with smarter and more interactive solutions.  

During the hackathon, we integrated **IBM Watson services** for **AI-powered responses**, implemented **Google APIs** for location tracking, and built an intuitive **Flask-based backend**. Our teamwork and innovation helped us build a project that could transform how tourists explore new places! 🌍
